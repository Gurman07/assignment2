                <p>When told that 400-450 farmers are at Ambala-Patiala district border, court ordered removal of barricades, saying security agencies can manage law and order. The court directed Punjab to cooperate with Haryana and asked farmer outfits to ensure no untoward incident takes place.The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday directed the Haryana government to remove barricades at the Shambhu border with Punjab within a week, where a group of farmers have been camping since February 13 when their Delhi Chalo march was halted.The order was passed by high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia and justice Vikas Bahl after it resumed hearing on a bunch of petitions on farmer-related issues and against the blockade.While ordering the opening of the barricades, the court observed: “The closure is causing great inconvenience to the general public.”

                    Before ordering the removal of barricades, the bench enquired about the number of farmers who are still camping at the border of the Ambala and Patiala districts. When it was informed that nearly 400-450 farmers are present, the court ordered the removal of barricades, saying that security agencies can manage the law and order situation.

                <p>In a major development, the Supreme Court on Friday granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal in the matter related to his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the agency's money laundering probe in the larger Delhi liquor policy case. The three-judge bench also referred Kejriwal's plea against his arrest to a larger bench.
                    However, the Delhi chief minister will remain jailed due to his judicial custody in a separate case being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the same matter.
                    
                    Earlier, the apex court reserved its verdict on the plea by Kejriwal, who is represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, on May 17. The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) national convenor was arrested by the ED on March 21, having skipped all nine summons sent by the federal agency.In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Kejriwal argued that the his arrest after the announcement (March 18) of the General Elections was "motivated by extraneous considerations".
    
                    The Delhi chief minister approached the apex court against the April 9 order of the Delhi High Court that upheld his arrest in the case. </p>

                    Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq recalled Pakistan's heartbreaking loss in the T20 World Cup 2007 final against India. He rued Pakistan's loss in a thrilling final, which India won by 5 runs. Misbah admitted that over-confidence led to their downfall as they failed to chase down the target. Misbah, who led the Pakistan team in the final of the tournament, had almost brought them towards the brink of a victory. However, he could not help his team cross the line when they needed 13 runs off the final over to lift the maiden title

New Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Union Labour Secretary Sumita Dawra have started meeting representatives of various trade unions seeking their cooperation to implement the controversial legislation.Though passed in both Houses, the codes are not yet operational apparently due to the objection of trade unions. The Centre has been maintaining that some States are yet to frame the rules for the codes.</p>

                <p>The Muslim religious bodies have decided to adopt a wait and watch approach with respect to Supreme Courts verdict earlier this week on Muslim women being entitled to a claim of maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 against her erstwhile husband.The All India Muslim Personal Board (AIMPLB), while calling the verdict as being against the Muslim personal law, has opted for a cautious approach. AIMPLB spokesman SQR Ilyas told The Hindu, “The Supreme Court decision giving lifelong alimony to divorced Muslim women is against Sharia laws. In India Muslims are governed by Shariat Application Act which is based on Sharia, as Hindus are governed by the Hindu Code. Article 25 of the Constitution also guarantees freedom of religion. Therefore court must refrain from applying IPC or CrPC. contradicting the above provisions.” Mr. Ilyas revealed that the Boards legal committee is studying the judgement. “On its advice, the Board may seek legal and other options available to us,” Mr. Ilyas said.</p>

                <p>New Delhi: Citing legislations by its state governments to ensure justice for gig workers, the Congress on Thursday said India needs a national legal and social security architecture for such workers and hoped that the forthcoming Union Budget will take a step in that direction. Congress general secretary, in-charge communications, Jairam Ramesh said the Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024 is a landmark rights-based legislation that brings formal rights and social security to platform-based gig workers in the state. The Karnataka Government last month released a draft of the proposed Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024 aimed to protect their rights in the state with creation of a board, welfare fund and grievance cell among other mechanisms.Ramesh listed some of the features of the bill such as establishing the gig workers social security and welfare fund and gig workers welfare board to advocate for gig workers. The bill also calls for mandatory registration of all gig workers with the government and states that aggregators can no longer terminate a worker without giving 14 days prior notice and a valid reason. According to the bill, aggregators must make payments to gig workers every week. “Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has been a leading voice for Indias gig workers since the Bharat Jodo Yatra,” Ramesh said in his post on X.</p>

                <p>The NEET-UG counselling process for undergraduate medical seats is set to kick off in four rounds, commencing in the third week of July, as confirmed by the government. The announcement was made in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, which is currently reviewing a series of petitions, some of which call for the cancellation of the NEET-UG exam due to an alleged paper leak.The government has assured that any student discovered to have benefited from malpractice will have their candidature revoked at any point during the counselling phase or even thereafter.

                    The NEET-UG counselling is crucial for allocating seats to successful candidates based on their examination scores. The Medical Counselling Committee, established under the health ministry, oversees counselling for all-India quota seats, while state quota seats are managed by the respective state counselling committees.
                    
                    During the counselling process, candidates are required to submit their preferences for medical colleges, with seat allocations being determined by their scores. The government clarified in its affidavit that candidates can change their seat selections in the first and second rounds of counselling based on their preferences.</p>
